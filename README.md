## Syllabus

### Introduction to Deep Learning

Start by learning the fundamentals of deep learning, and then examining the foundational algorithms underpinning modern deep learning: gradient descent and backpropagation. Once those foundations are established, explore design constructs of neural networks and the impact of these design decisions. Finally, the course explores how neural network training can be optimized for accuracy and robustness.

**Project 1 - Developing a Handwritten Digits classifier with PyTorch**

### Convolutional Neural Networks

This course introduces convolutional neural networks, the most widely used type of neural networks specialized in image processing. You will learn the main characteristics of CNNs that make them better than standard neural networks for image processing. Then you’ll examine the inner workings of CNNs and apply the architectures to custom datasets using transfer learning. Finally, you will learn how to use CNNs for object detection and semantic segmentation.

**Project 2 - Landmark Classification and Tagging for Social Media**

### RNNs & Transformers

This course covers multiple RNN architectures and discusses design patterns for those models. Additionally, you’ll focus on the latest transformer architectures.

**Project 3 - LSTM Seq2Seq Chatbot**

### Building Generative Adversial Networks

Become familiar with generative adversarial networks (GANs) by learning how to build and train different GANs architectures to generate new images. Discover, build, and train architectures such as DCGAN, CycleGAN, ProGAN, and StyleGAN on diverse datasets including the MNIST dataset, Summer2Winter Yosemite dataset, or CelebA dataset.

**Project 4 - Face Generation using CelebA dataset and training using GANs**
