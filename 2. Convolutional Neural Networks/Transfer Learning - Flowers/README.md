## Exercise: Transfer Learning, Flowers

Aapply transfer learning in a new task!

### Instructions

Instructions are outlined in the `notebook transfer_learning.ipynb`, which has some starter code in it. The task is to complete all the parts in the notebook marked `# YOUR CODE HERE`.

At any time you can right-click on the orange Jupyter icon at the top and select "Open in a new tab" or similar, to open the main window in a new tab. From there you can open `helpers.py` and see how the functions used in the notebook work.

### Reflecting on the Performance Difference

In the notebook, the performance obtained with transfer learning is significantly better than the performance training from scratch.
