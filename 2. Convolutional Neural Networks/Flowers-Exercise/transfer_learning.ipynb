    "In this notebook, you'll be modeling a small dataset of fewer than 5000 natural images. As the diagram above suggests, in a case like this you can use the pre-trained network as a feature extractor and substitute the head. Since 5000 is small but not very small, you can also try to squeeze some more performance by fine-tuning the rest of the network. You will need to use a learning rate small enough so you do not destroy the filters that the network has learned on ImageNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will load a pre-trained ResNet model, remove the head, and substitute it with your own head. Then you will fix the feature extractor part and train the head. It is relatively easy to approach an accuracy of around 90% by using this transfer learning technique! Then you will fine-tune the rest of the network. Be careful in using a small learning rate! Experimentation usually is needed to find the right learning rate. Here we will use 1/100th of the initial learning rate. \n",
